AI_web_scrapper_selenium_llama

This project is a Streamlit web application that scrapes website content using Selenium, cleans and processes the data, and then utilizes the Llama 3.2 language model to extract relevant information based on user queries.

Features:


Scrapes website content dynamically using selenium.
Cleans extracted content to remove unnecessary elements, reducing token usage.
Splits content into batches of 25,000 characters to comply with LLM input constraints.
Passes processed content to Llama 3.2 for answering user queries.


Installation

Prerequisites:


Python 3.8+
Google Chrome installed (undetected-chromedriver manages the matching driver automatically)
Ollama installed and running locally, with the Llama 3.2 model pulled:


ollama pull llama3.2

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Make sure Ollama is running locally, then start the Streamlit app with:

streamlit run main.py

Workflow:


Enter a website URL in the input field.
Click "Scrape Site" to extract and clean content.
View the cleaned DOM content.
Provide a description of the information you want to extract.
Click "Parse content" to process the data with Llama 3.2.


Modules

scrape.py


Uses undetected-chromedriver to fetch and render the webpage.
Scrolls the page to mimic human behavior.
Extracts the raw HTML content.


clean.py


Removes unnecessary elements like <script>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, and <noscript> tags.
Strips out navigation bars, footers, and comments.
Splits large content into chunks of 25,000 characters.


parse.py


Uses langchain_ollama to pass text chunks to Llama 3.2.
Extracts and formats relevant information based on user input.


Improvements


Implementing a tokenizer to count tokens dynamically before sending requests to the LLM.
Enhancing the extraction process to handle multi-page websites.
Introducing caching mechanisms for improved efficiency.

Acknowledgement

This project is a derivative work inspired by the excellent tutorial "Python AI Web Scraper Tutorial" by Tech with Tim, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo8-nEuDBkk.

While the core structure of the project is based on Tech with Tim's tutorial, I have made significant modifications, especially regarding the scraping logic, HTML cleaning, and Llama integration.

Note

To ensure the highest success rate when scraping websites, consider integrating a proxy and captcha solving service like Bright Data, Smart Proxy, or Scraping Ant. These services provide a pool of rotating residential proxies and powerful captcha solvers, which are crucial for bypassing website blocks and CAPTCHAs. While this Selenium-based scraper incorporates a header with a User-Agent, mouse scrolling, and timed pauses to mimic human behavior, it will likely encounter limitations.
